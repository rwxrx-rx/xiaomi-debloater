# Changelog

All notable changes to the Xiaomi Debloater app are documented here. Package
list updates (`bloatware.json`) reach the app without a release, so they are
not listed.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
