# Xiaomi Debloater — remove MIUI & HyperOS bloatware without root

**Xiaomi Debloater** is a free, open-source desktop app for removing bloatware, ads and telemetry from Xiaomi, Redmi and POCO phones running **MIUI** or **HyperOS 1, 2 and 3**. It works over ADB, needs **no root and no bootloader unlock**, and runs on **Windows, macOS and Linux**. There is also a CLI edition that runs directly on the phone with **Android (Termux)**, see [Android (Termux)](#android-termux).

Unlike general-purpose tools, it only covers Xiaomi. The package list is built for MIUI and HyperOS, rates each package's risk, and gets updates for new Xiaomi OS releases without you reinstalling the app.

## Features

- **640+ MIUI / HyperOS packages** with plain-English descriptions and a risk rating: 288 safe, 218 caution, 134 danger ("never remove").
- **Always up to date:** the app downloads the latest package list from this repo, so new HyperOS packages are recognised as soon as they are added here.
- **Reversible:** apps are uninstalled for your user only (`pm uninstall -k --user 0`). Removed apps stay listed in the **Removed** tab with a Restore button; nothing is deleted from the system partition.
- **Disable, uninstall, enable, restore** per app, or remove many at once after a confirmation.
- **Filter** by Bloatware, OEM (Xiaomi apps), System, User and Disabled, or search by name.
- **Built-in guide** to debloating MIUI and HyperOS safely, including privacy settings that need no ADB.
- Detects the phone model, MIUI or HyperOS version, and Android version.
- Every action is recorded in an operation log.

## Supported phones

Any Xiaomi, Redmi or POCO phone with MIUI 12–14 or HyperOS 1, 2 or 3, including Global, EEA, India and China ROMs. HyperOS 3 packages come from the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and other models share most of them. If a package on your phone is missing or wrongly labelled, please [report it](https://github.com/fadeltd/xiaomi-debloater/issues/new?template=package-report.yml).

## How to debloat your Xiaomi phone

1. **Install ADB.** macOS: `brew install android-platform-tools`. Windows: `winget install Google.PlatformTools`. Linux: `sudo apt install adb`.
2. **Enable Developer options:** Settings > About phone, tap *MIUI version* or *OS version* 7 times.
3. **Enable USB debugging:** Settings > Additional settings > Developer options > *USB debugging*.
4. **Connect the phone by USB** and tap *Allow* on the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt.
5. **Open Xiaomi Debloater.** Your phone and its packages appear within a few seconds.
6. Start with the **Bloatware** tab and packages marked `safe`. Leave `danger` packages alone.

Read the in-app **Guide** tab before removing anything marked `caution`.

## Install

Every package manager below installs adb for you.

| Platform             | Command                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Homebrew)     | `brew install --cask fadeltd/tap/xiaomi-debloater`                                                                        |
| Windows (winget)     | `winget install fadeltd.XiaomiDebloater`                                                                                  |
| Windows (Scoop)      | `scoop bucket add fadeltd https://github.com/fadeltd/scoop-bucket` then `scoop install xiaomi-debloater`                  |
| Ubuntu, Debian, Mint | Download the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/fadeltd/xiaomi-debloater/releases), then `sudo apt install ./xiaomi-debloater_*.deb` |
| Fedora, openSUSE     | Download the `.rpm` from [Releases](https://github.com/fadeltd/xiaomi-debloater/releases), then `sudo dnf install ./xiaomi-debloater-*.rpm` |
| Linux (Snap)         | `sudo snap install android-debloater` then `sudo snap connect android-debloater:adb-support`                              |

Or download the app for Windows, macOS or Linux from [Releases](https://github.com/fadeltd/xiaomi-debloater/releases), or [build it yourself](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-app).

**macOS:** the app is not notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks the first launch. Run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Xiaomi Debloater.app"`, or open it once, then click *Open Anyway* in System Settings > Privacy & Security.

**Snap:** the snap bundles its own adb. Stop any other adb server first (`adb kill-server`), because only one can use the phone at a time.

## Android (Termux)

Debloat the phone from the phone itself, no PC needed. A CLI edition lives in [`termux/`](termux/) and uses the same `bloatware.json`. It needs Android 11+ (Wireless debugging) and no root.

**Quick install:** download `xiaomi-debloater-termux_*_all.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xiaomi-debloater/releases) (tags named `termux-v*`), then run `pkg install ./xiaomi-debloater-termux_*_all.deb` and start it with `xdebloat`. Or build from source:

1. Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid or GitHub, **not** the Play Store build.
2. Install the tools and get the code (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub name):

```sh
pkg update && pkg install python android-tools git
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xiaomi-debloater
cd xiaomi-debloater/termux
```

3. Turn on Wireless debugging: Settings > Developer options > *Wireless debugging* > *Pair device with pairing code*. Keep Termux in split-screen so the pairing dialog stays open.
4. Pair, connect and run:

```sh
python xdebloat.py pair IP:PAIR_PORT CODE
python xdebloat.py connect IP:CONNECT_PORT
python xdebloat.py          # interactive menu
```

Highlights: `list`, `remove`, `disable`, `enable`, `restore`, `--dry-run`, `--os auto`, automatic backups of every removal. `danger` packages are blocked. See [termux/README.md](termux/README.md) for all commands.

## FAQ

**Is it safe?** Packages are removed only for the current user, so they can be restored. Removing a package marked `danger` can still stop the phone from booting properly, and the fix may be a factory reset. Back up first.

**How do I restore a removed app?** Use *Restore* in the app, or run `adb shell cmd package install-existing <package.name>`. A factory reset also restores everything.

**Do I need root or an unlocked bootloader?** No. Everything runs through ADB with USB debugging.

**Will OTA updates still work?** Yes. User-level uninstalls don't block updates, but major updates can bring bloat back and add new packages. Update the list in the app and check again after each system update.

**Why not Universal Android Debloater?** [UAD-ng](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation) is excellent and covers every brand. Xiaomi Debloater focuses on Xiaomi only, with a list tracked per MIUI/HyperOS version and Xiaomi-specific guidance.
